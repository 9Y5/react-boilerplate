# SourceSage Web/Frontend Challenge
We've made this challenge to simulate a typical workflow working on the frontend.

As part of the challenge, you will be making some changes to the code in this repo. Further instructions can be found inside.

The solution is partially structured and deliberately open-ended -- this gives you the chance to clarify the spec with us, and leaves some room for expression.

We are looking out for these things for this exercise:
* Your familiarity with `git` workflow
* Ability to pick up our frontend stack
* Code style

## Dependencies
You need to have `nodejs` and `npm` installed.

Download them here if you haven't already: [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation
Clone this repository, then run

`npm install`.

## Development
To start developing your solution, you can use the built-in dev server by running

`npm start`.

Then visit `localhost:3000`.

## Submission

When you're ready to submit, make a branch, then create a pull request on this repository.
